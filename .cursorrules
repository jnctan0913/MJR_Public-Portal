# Cursor Rules for Pixel-Perfect Figma Implementation

## Core Principle
Every UI element MUST match the Figma design exactly. When in doubt, refer to Figma via MCP.

## Framework Priority
1. **Next.js** (App Router preferred)
2. **React** (with TypeScript)

## Design Implementation Requirements

### 1. Figma Reference Protocol
- ALWAYS query Figma designs via MCP before starting any UI component
- Extract exact values for:
  - Spacing (padding, margin, gaps)
  - Colors (hex codes, opacity)
  - Typography (font family, size, weight, line height, letter spacing)
  - Border radius, shadows, and effects
  - Component dimensions (width, height)
  - Layout properties (flex, grid, positioning)

### 2. Styling Approach
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling (primary method)
- For complex styles not achievable with Tailwind, use CSS modules
- Never approximate values - use exact px/rem values from Figma
- Maintain exact spacing system from Figma design tokens

### 3. Asset Management

#### Image Placeholders
When Figma design includes images/assets:
